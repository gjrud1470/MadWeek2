# MadCamp Week2 Project

Made by 허경 and 구윤회(https://github.com/samsara-ku)

By using Node.js server, added login service and synchronization to server with personal contact and images from gallary.
With Node.js and Socket.io, realtime 2-player dodge&shooting game is in Tab3.
Without using game engine, personally defined particle class is used for each objects.
  Since personally defined class is used, this is NOT OPTIMIZED. Uses lots of computation and temperature of device rises as game proceeds.

Following git repositories are server repositories.
